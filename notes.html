        <h3>How I satisfied the rubric:</h3>
        The index.html page shows all the pokemons name, number, base experience, height, and weight. Users can sort each category by clicking on the table header. For more information about a pokemon, user can click on a table cell of that pokemon's row to see more information. That was 2 way of organize the data, which satisfied the rubric.
        <br />
        For interface, I used a pokemon background which has been brighten to not make it too colorful. Header uses pokemon font. Table has alternate colors for odd and even rows. Table cell change color when hover on it. When sorting, there is a small icon shows whether it's sorting ascending or descending. The pokemon information page is also layout in an easy way to look at.
        <br />
        For other things, sorting is alternate between ascending and descending after each click. URL objects were used to go back and forth between the full table of data and a specific pokemon's information.
        <br />
        I should have shown more pokemons, but when I try expand the limit, some pokemons' link does not exist, which result in error and it doesn't work anymore. So I have to stop at 200 pokemons.
