    Notes About Pokemon Project
  </h1>
  
 <p>
   Our first task at hand was to select an public API we both found interesting as well as make our data bind
   with our created "td's". Thir required a promise that we successfully completed relativly quickly. We 
   immediately agreed that mutliple attributes of the Pokemon was neccessary such that could satisfy the data while
   achieving the maximum amount of points.

    We first completed our interface as a whole then worried about the actual design features and how to get our
    colors to blend nicely. At first we added just simple CSS with Pokemon colors but after deliberation it just
    wasnt enough as we wanted our project to stand out as well as be pleasurble to the eye.
